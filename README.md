> [!NOTE]
> This program is WIP, some of my code sucks and some features are lacking.

## 🔽Download Here
[Latest Release](https://github.com/haiku-balls/haikusMediaPlayer/releases/latest)

## ❓Why?
I wanted a simple media player that looks appealing. WinUI was up to the task and developing it with a simplistic mindset allowed me to imagine this program.

## ✨Feature Set
- Open a music file or folder. (Currently only .mp3 and .flac)

## ✨Planned
- Playlist viewer
- Better code (ohmyogds)
